<p>This is <b>civitaz</b>. It is an <b>xmpp</b> server and the future home of some other federated projects.</p>
<h3>civitaz xmpp</h3>
<p>The <b>civitaz xmpp</b> is open for public registration. At the moment, it requires an xmpp client to create your account.</p>
<p>We will, however, be building in a way to register accounts right here on the site.</p>
<p><b><i>===how to register an account===</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Download an xmpp client - we're recommending a few further down the page that you can check out. They are free and open source software, just like xmpp.</li>
<li>On your xmpp client, find "create an account" or the equivalent, and create your account using either "examplename@civitaz.xyz" and your desired password, or "examplename" as your username and "civitaz.xyz" as the domain - depending on the xmpp client. Replace <i>examplename</i> with the username of your choice.</li>
<li>Once your account is created, sign in using the details you specified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are successfully signed into your new xmpp account on <b>civitaz</b>, you can add people from any other xmpp server. All you need is their username and server name (yours is <b><i>yourusername</i>@civitaz.xyz</b>).</p>
<p>We will be making some short how-to's on how beginners can sign in and register with some of the best xmpp clients.</p>
<h3>The best xmpp clients</h3>
<p>These are some of the best ones I have used. I don't use Windows or Mac or iOS, so you will have to find good recommendations for those - I won't recommend something I haven't personally used - though I will happily share positive reviews from people who have actually used the software.</p>
<p><i>The best advice - use free and open source software! xmpp is a great example of software that is owned by no-one and decentralized, able to be run by anyone, anywhere, for any reason.</i></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>~ ~ ~ ~ ~</b></p>
<p><a href="https://gajim.org">Gajim</a> - <b>Linux</b></p>
<p>This is a great xmpp client for Linux distributions that comes packaged in most distro's standard repositories.</p>
<p>It is lightweight, classic-looking, and extensible with PGP and OMEMO encryption.</p>
<p>To get it, just run:</p>
<code>sudo apt install gajim</code>
<p> in Debian/Ubuntu based distros, or:</p>
<code>sudo pacman -Sy gajim</code>
<p>For Arch based distros.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>~ ~ ~ ~ ~</b></p>
<p><a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> - <b>Android</b></p>
<p>Conversations is one of the premier xmpp apps for Android. Even better, it is available from the F-Droid appstore, a store full of nothing but free and open-source applications.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/">download Conversations on F-Droid</a></p>

<p>These are a few of the best clients for connecting with your friends over xmpp. Use your new <b>civitaz</b> account and start chatting today, privately and securely.</p>
