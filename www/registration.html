<h3>making an account on civitaz</h3>
<p>Want to use our publicly available <b>xmpp server</b> for your own private and secure communication? Great. Here is how.</p>
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;text-align:center">
  <p>You need to use an xmpp client to sign up currently. I will be working on bringing web registration to this site soon.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Download an xmpp client - we're recommending a few <a href="xmpp-clients.html">at this link</a> that you can check out. They are free and open source software, just like xmpp.</li>
<li>On your xmpp client, find "create an account" or the equivalent, and create your account using either "examplename@civitaz.xyz" and your desired password, or "examplename" as your username and "civitaz.xyz" as the domain - depending on the xmpp client. Replace <i>examplename</i> with the username of your choice.</li>
<li>Once your account is created, sign in using the details you specified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are successfully signed into your new xmpp account on <b>civitaz</b>, you can add people from any other xmpp server. All you need is their username and server name (yours is <b><i>yourusername</i>@civitaz.xyz</b>).</p>
<p>We will be making some short how-to's on how beginners can sign in and register with some of the best xmpp clients.</p>
<p><i>Keep your eye out for a new page here soon - I aim to bring web registration to make it that much simpler to sign up and begin chatting.</i></p>
